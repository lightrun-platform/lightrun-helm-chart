Before you deploy the Lightrun Helm Chart, ensure your cloud environment is ready with a properly configured Kubernetes cluster.

Based on the default resource values for all services deployed locally (including RabbitMQ, Redis, and MySQL), your Kubernetes cluster should have at least:
- **CPU:** 10 cores (10,000m)
- **Memory:** 26Gi
